## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**: Raw data from Rezdy API
2. **Validation**: Zod schema validation and error handling
3. **Cleaning**: Automated normalization and enrichment
4. **Caching**: Multi-level caching with smart invalidation
5. **Segmentation**: Real-time filtering and categorization
6. **Analytics**: Insights generation and performance monitoring
7. **Presentation**: Interactive dashboards and enhanced search

### Performance Optimizations

- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching with LRU/FIFO/TTL policies
- **Data Validation**: Efficient schema validation with error recovery
- **Segmentation**: Optimized filtering algorithms with memoization
- **Analytics**: Real-time computation with cached intermediate results

### Error Handling

- Comprehensive error tracking and logging
- Graceful degradation for data quality issues
- User-friendly error messages and recovery options
- Performance monitoring with alerting capabilities

## Usage Examples

### Basic Data Management

```typescript
const {
  data,
  filteredProducts,
  segmentedProducts,
  qualityMetrics,
  isLoading,
  error,
  refreshData
} = useRezdyDataManager({
  enableCaching: true,
  enableValidation: true,
  enableSegmentation: true,
  autoRefresh: false
});
```

### Enhanced Search

```typescript
<EnhancedSearchForm
  products={data.products}
  onResults={handleSearchResults}
  onFiltersChange={handleFiltersChange}
/>
```

### Analytics Dashboard

```typescript
<DataAnalyticsDashboard />
```

## Configuration Options

### Data Manager Options

- `enableCaching`: Enable/disable caching functionality
- `enableValidation`: Enable/disable data validation
- `enableSegmentation`: Enable/disable data segmentation
- `autoRefresh`: Enable/disable automatic data refresh
- `refreshInterval`: Set refresh interval in milliseconds

### Cache Configuration

- `ttl`: Time-to-live for cache entries
- `max_size`: Maximum cache size
- `eviction_policy`: LRU, FIFO, or TTL eviction policy

## Performance Metrics

The system tracks comprehensive performance metrics:

- **Cache Hit Ratio**: Percentage of cache hits vs misses
- **Data Freshness**: How current the cached data is
- **API Response Time**: Average response time for API calls
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed operations
- **Data Quality Score**: Overall data quality assessment

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Real-time Webhooks**: Integration with Rezdy webhooks for real-time updates
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning-based insights and predictions

4. **Custom Dashboards**: User-configurable dashboard layouts
5. **API Rate Limiting**: Intelligent rate limiting and request optimization

### Scalability Considerations

- **Database Integration**: Move from in-memory to persistent storage
- **Microservices**: Split data management into separate services
- **CDN Integration**: Global content delivery for cached data
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute processing across multiple instances

## Testing and Quality Assurance
