### Integration Points

#### Site Header (`components/site-header.tsx`)
- Desktop: Added `ThemeToggle` component next to phone number and Book Now button
- Mobile: Added `ThemeToggleSimple` component in the mobile sheet menu
- Imports both theme toggle components

#### Layout Configuration (`app/layout.tsx`)
- Updated `ThemeProvider` configuration:
  - `defaultTheme="system"`: Respects user's OS preference by default
  - `enableSystem`: Allows system theme detection
  - Removed `disableTransitionOnChange` for smooth transitions

#### Global Styles (`app/globals.css`)
- Added comprehensive CSS transitions for theme changes
- Smooth transitions for:
  - Background colors
  - Text colors
  - Border colors
  - Box shadows
  - SVG fill and stroke
- Preserved specific animations (spin, pulse, bounce)
- Excluded state-based transitions to prevent conflicts

## Technical Architecture

### Theme System
- **Library**: `next-themes` for React/Next.js theme management
- **Method**: CSS class-based theme switching (`darkMode: ["class"]`)
- **Storage**: LocalStorage for theme persistence
- **SSR**: Proper hydration handling to prevent flash

### CSS Variables
The theme system uses CSS custom properties defined in `globals.css`:

```css
:root {
  --background: 0 0% 100%;
  --foreground: 0 0% 3.9%;
  /* ... other light theme variables */
}

.dark {
  --background: 0 0% 3.9%;
  --foreground: 0 0% 98%;
  /* ... other dark theme variables */
}
```

### Transition System
Smooth transitions are applied globally while preserving specific animations:

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  transition: 
    background-color 0.3s ease,
    border-color 0.3s ease,
    color 0.3s ease,
    fill 0.3s ease,
    stroke 0.3s ease,
    opacity 0.3s ease,
    box-shadow 0.3s ease,
    transform 0.3s ease;
}
```

## User Experience

### Desktop Experience
1. User clicks the theme toggle button (sun/moon icon)
2. Dropdown menu appears with three options
3. User selects preferred theme
4. Page smoothly transitions to new theme
5. Selection is saved for future visits

### Mobile Experience
1. User opens mobile navigation menu
2. User sees theme toggle button with current theme icon
3. User taps button to cycle to next theme
4. Page smoothly transitions to new theme
5. Selection is saved for future visits

### Theme Cycling Order
- **Light** â†’ **Dark** â†’ **System** â†’ **Light** (repeats)

## Browser Support
- **Modern Browsers**: Full support with smooth transitions
- **Legacy Browsers**: Graceful degradation without transitions
- **JavaScript Disabled**: Falls back to system theme

## Performance Considerations
- **Hydration**: Proper SSR handling prevents layout shift
- **Transitions**: Optimized CSS transitions for smooth performance
- **Storage**: Efficient localStorage usage for theme persistence
- **Bundle Size**: Minimal impact using existing dependencies

## Customization

### Branding Colors
The theme toggle uses Pineapple Tours' yellow branding:
- **Hover States**: `yellow-100` (light) / `yellow-900/20` (dark)
- **Text Colors**: `yellow-800` (light) / `yellow-300` (dark)
- **Focus Rings**: `yellow-500` with proper offset

### Icon Animations
- **Sun Icon**: Rotates and scales on theme change
- **Moon Icon**: Smooth fade and rotation transitions
- **Monitor Icon**: Static display for system theme
